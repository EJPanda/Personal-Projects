Neural Machine Translation of Languages

Project Status: On-going. Working on NMT using RNN to translate English into French.

This project is a proof of concept project to study neural machine translation (NMT) by making deep learning models translating the English language into the French language. In the future, I plan to see the how the model gets affected by reversing the source and target languages. I also plan to expand this project to include additional languages.
