Written by: Eric J. Puttock

This repository is for my personal projects that I do for fun to practice my skills as a Data Scientist.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn if you'd like discuss my work or provide suggestions.

Let's make a positive change in the world!


Project List:

Benign vs Malignant Tumor Classification (Last Updated: 08/31/2020)
- Primary Objective: Can we correctly diagnose a breast cancer tumor as benign or malignant with high accuracy given a set of morphological features?
- Uses the UCI Machine Learning Repository: University of Wisconsin Breast Tumor Diagnosis dataset.
    

Projects to be added in near future:

Cat vs Dog Classification:
 - Identify cat/dogs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Utilizing image datasets provided by Microsoft Research for a Kaggle competition.

Naive Binary Sentiment Analysis Classification:
 - Determine whether an opinion is more positive or negative using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Utilizing IMDB movie reviews for Sentiment Analysis provided by Andrew Maas on his Stanford website.
