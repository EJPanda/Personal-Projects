Introduction: Machine Learning & Need for Diagnostic Tools

Machine learning is widely used in many applications ranging from estimating a price of a home, classifying and analyzing regions of an image (for example, MRI scans), and even translating words into another language! Having worked in the field of mathematical biology for nearly a decade, I wanted to look into a project that is simple and is at the intersection of data science and biology.

Cancer is the number one leading cause of death in the WORLD with Lung, Breast, Colon being the top 3 [World Health Organization (WHO)]. Lung cancer and Colon cancer are among the top most diagnosed cancers around the globe. Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, with one in 20 people diagnosed with colon cancer in their lifetime. It is also distinctly an age-related disease, with most patients being diagnosed over the age of 50 (Society, A.C., Colorectal Cancer Facts & Figures 2017-2019. 2017). Tumors are lumps of tissue that can be cancerous (Malignant) or not cancerous (Benign). Being able to diagnose patients early before the progression of the disease can lead to better patient care and greater chances of survival.

Primary Objective: Can we correctly diagnose a breast cancer tumor as benign or malignant with high accuracy given a set of morphological features?

In this project, I aim to investigate whether a benign or malignant tumor can be identified from a set of experimental measurements.

Additionally, we also aim to identify which features have the most weight in determining/predicting that a tumor is beign or malignant. We attempt to do this by using some well-known simple classification techniques in the field of machine learning.
