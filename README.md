- IBM Capstone Project for my IBMs Data Science Specialization course on Coursera.
- Webscraping of city names within Los Angeles County from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Los_Angeles_County,_California).
- Uses [FourSquare](https://foursquare.com/) [API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/endpoints/) to collect venue information from Geo-spatial coordinates of cities.
- KMeans clustering to study cities based on most common venues within Los Angeles County.
- Visualization using Folium package.

[**Benign vs Malignant Tumor Classification**](https://github.com/EJPanda/Personal-Projects/tree/master/EJP%20-%20Benign%20vs%20Malignant%20Tumor%20Classification) (Last Updated: 2020.8.31)
- Primary Objective: Can we correctly diagnose a breast cancer tumor as benign or malignant with high accuracy given a set of morphological features?
- Uses [University of Wisconsin Breast Tumor (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

- Determine whether a movie review is positive or negative using recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
- Uses IMDB movie reviews for Sentiment Analysis provided by Andrew Maas on his Stanford [website](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/index.html).
- Uses [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) for transfer learning of weights.

[**Neural Machine Translation of Languages**](https://github.com/EJPanda/Personal-Projects/tree/master/EJP%20-%20Neural%20Machine%20Translation%20of%20Languages): (Last Updated: 2020.9.04)
- Proof of concept deep learning models translating the English language into the French language.
- Uses data provided from DataCamp learning course, ["Machine Translation in Python"](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/machine-translation-in-python).

[**Parks & Recreation AI**](https://github.com/EJPanda/Personal-Projects/tree/master/EJP%20-%20Parks%20%26%20Recreation%20AI): (Last Updated: 2020.9.04)
- An attempt to create an artificial Leslie Knope (and other characters) using recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
- Uses transcripts from the television show Parks and Recreation (https://www.kaggle.com/heheheluke/parks-and-recreation-scripts).

### Future Project List to be Uploaded:

- **Cat vs Dog Image Classification**:
   - Identify cat/dogs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
   - Utilizing image datasets provided by Microsoft Research for a Kaggle competition.

- **Spam vs Ham Email Classification**:
   - Identify e-mails as spam or ham using Random Forest & Gradient Boosting classification techniques.
   - Utilizing data provided from LinkedIn learning course, ["NLP with Python for Machine Learning Essential Training"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/nlp-with-python-for-machine-learning-essential-training).
